Modifications
=============

## How does this work?
When you write a modification for ModernBB, you can fork this repository and add a pull request to this repo. Your modification will be added to the list. You can request a new build in the issue tracker. When you do so, we will create a archive of the current version of your plugin and upload it to ModernBB.be (http://modernbb.be/modifications.php). You can request a new build whenever you want (here: https://github.com/ModernBB/Modifications/issues/new), but don't go crazy with it (at least 2 days between new builds please). This is a temporary solutions, since we have to do this by hand.

## Requirements
When you want to pull your modification to this repository. You have to follow those rules:

- You're modification can't use a name that is already in use
- You have to include a readme.txt file, see the content below
